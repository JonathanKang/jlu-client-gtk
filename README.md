# jlu-client-gtk
The GTK client for Drcom login in Jilin University.

I just had the idea and started to write this program, the code is sort of ugly and need some further improvement. So does the functionality of the program. 

To run it, just use the following command:
  python jlu-drcom-login.py

TODO:
1. Add remember password function
2. Use GtkStack to switch between login window and the debug information output window
3. Add logout functionality to client.py, so we don't have to force quit after clicking the close button
